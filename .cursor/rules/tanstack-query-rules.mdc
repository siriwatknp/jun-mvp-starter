## TanStack Query

- Use string literals directly in the useQuery hooks for queryKey, avoid abstracting them into separate objects or constants.
- Keep query keys simple, using an array with a prefix string and an object for parameters.
- Only refactor duplicated query keys when the same exact query is used in 3+ places, and even then, ask first.
